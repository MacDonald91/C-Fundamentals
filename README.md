# C-Fundamentals

C# Fundamentals Demo
Author: MacDonald Industries

This repository contains a simple C# console application designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts, as practiced during my Codecademy learning journey.

Project Overview
The GalacticTravelAgency console application demonstrates several core C# concepts through a simulated passenger data management scenario. It highlights:

Variable Declaration and Initialization: How to declare and assign initial values to different data types (string, int).

Arithmetic Operations: Performing basic operations like incrementing an integer variable.

Type Conversions:

Explicit Conversion (int to double): Demonstrating a deliberate cast from one data type to another.

Implicit Conversion (int to double): Showing how C# automatically converts types when it's safe to do so without loss of data.

Convert.ToString() Method: Converting a numeric type (int) into its string representation.

Technologies Used
C#: The programming language used.

.NET SDK: The software development kit for building .NET applications.

.NET: The free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

Visual Studio Code: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing and debugging the code.

GitHub: Used for version control and hosting the project repository.

How to Run the Project
To run this project, you will need the .NET SDK installed on your machine.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MacDonald91/C-Fundamentals
cd C-Fundamentals

Navigate to the project directory:
If the Program.cs file is directly in the root, you can run from there. Otherwise, navigate to the folder containing the .csproj file (e.g., cd GalacticTravelAgency).

Run the application:

dotnet run

The console application will execute, displaying the output of each step, demonstrating the C# fundamentals.

Example Output
Here's what you can expect to see when running the application in your terminal:

Code Structure
The core logic resides within the Program.cs file:

Main Method: The entry point of the application, where all the demonstrations are executed sequentially.

Comments: Extensive comments are used throughout the code to explain each step and the C# concepts being demonstrated.

Learning and Application
This project reflects foundational skills in C# that are crucial for building robust software solutions. I am eager to apply these skills and grow within a dynamic environment.
